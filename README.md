# BBCNewsJS

I am not an experienced front end programmer, and would like to be considered for back-end programming.
I am inexperienced for both tests provided (I have not written programs for Android or IOS, and have only done some very basic JavaScript in the first term of my first year at university).

Due to a busy coursework period for university, I was only able to allocate 2 days towards this project, in which I would need to learn a lot of JavaScript (I have never dynamically created websites, not encounted stubs or read in JSON data), and then create a website to meet the tasks requirements.

I completed this and had a working project (except for outputting JSON at the end) in netbeans (which is what I was taught to code JavaScript in).
The JSON files were hosted locally (in the project file) and the program ran quite smoothly, which I was pleased with.

When I went to upload my project file, I realised there was an email from the BBC that had been blocked by the university email system from the 18th of February, and I had not been notified by the system.
This is the first time that any emails from the BBC have been blocked (perhaps due to the network maintenance that has been happening this week?)

This was the important email that stated that all web tests must be completed on GitHub and, with a couple hours left before the deadline, there was no chance that I would be able to rewrite it in GitHub (again, not even covered at university).

Although I am pretty certain that you won't be calling me in for an interview, I have upload the script written in netbeans incase it is of interest to you. At least I have gained some valuable experience in writing JavaScript!


Sorry to be an inconvenience,

Liam Bennett.
